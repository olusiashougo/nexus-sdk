# nexus-toolkit

The **Nexus Toolkit** provides essential interfaces and functions for easily
developing Nexus Tools using Rust.

## Usage

You have two easy ways to get started with the Nexus Toolkit:

### Using Nexus CLI (recommended)

The easiest way is to create a fresh Rust project preconfigured for Nexus Tool
development. To do this, first install the [Nexus CLI][nexus-cli-docs], then run:

```sh
nexus tool new --help
```

This command lists all available options to quickly set up your development
environment.

### Manually Adding Dependencies

You can also manually include the Nexus Toolkit in your existing project.
Add the following lines to your project's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.nexus-toolkit]
git = "https://github.com/Talus-Network/nexus-sdk"
tag = "v0.1.0"
package = "nexus-toolkit"
```
